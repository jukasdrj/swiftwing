Epic Overview - epic-5-visual-intelligence.md\n    - Business value, architecture, success metrics\n    - 227 story points, $2,400 annual savings\n  2. Sprint Plans (5 detailed documents):\n    - sprint-1-foundation.md - Multi-book segmentation (2 weeks)\n    - sprint-2-extraction.md - OCR + AI extraction (2 weeks)\n    - sprint-3-talaria-hybrid.md - Background enrichment (3 weeks)\n    - sprint-4-analytics-polish.md - Accuracy tracking (2 weeks)\n    - sprint-5-testing-rollout.md - Beta + production (3 weeks)\n  3. Executive Summary - EPIC-5-SUMMARY.md\n    - Quick reference for all sprints\n    - Critical path, dependencies, risks\n  4. Quick Start Guide - SPRINT-1-QUICK-START.md\n    - Day-by-day implementation guide\n    - Code snippets, testing strategy, demo script\n\n  ---\n  🎯 Key Features of the Plan\n\n  ✅ Parallel Execution: 3 concurrent tracks per sprint (maximize velocity)\n\n  ✅ Review Tab Focus: Critical to the epic - users verify AI extractions before saving\n\n  ✅ Progressive Enhancement:\n  - Sprint 1: User sees \"Processing 5 books...\" feedback\n  - Sprint 2: User sees extracted titles/authors in Review tab\n  - Sprint 3: User sees cover images load automatically\n  - Sprint 4-5: 92% accuracy validated, 100% rollout\n\n  ✅ Cost Optimization:\n  - Current: $0.021/scan (Gemini Flash)\n  - Target: $0.001/scan (Foundation Models)\n  - 96% reduction for multi-book scans\n\n  ✅ Zero Breaking Changes:\n  - Feature flags control rollout\n  - Single-book workflow preserved\n  - Talaria stays as fallback\n\n  ---\n  📊 Sprint Structure\n\n  Sprint 1 (Weeks 1-2)  → Foundation [42 pts]\n    ├─ Track A: Instance Segmentation\n    ├─ Track B: Processing Feedback UI\n    └─ Track C: Review Tab Foundation\n\n  Sprint 2 (Weeks 3-4)  → Extraction [46 pts]\n    ├─ Track A: RecognizeDocumentsRequest\n    ├─ Track B: Foundation Models Service\n    └─ Track C: Review Tab Detail View\n\n  Sprint 3 (Weeks 5-7)  → Hybrid [47 pts]\n    ├─ Track A: Talaria Text Enrichment\n    ├─ Track B: Result Reconciliation\n    └─ Track C: Multi-Book Grid UI\n\n  Sprint 4 (Weeks 8-9)  → Analytics [38 pts]\n    ├─ Track A: Accuracy Tracker\n    ├─ Track B: Performance Optimization\n    └─ Track C: Feature Flags\n\n  Sprint 5 (Weeks 10-12) → Testing [54 pts]\n    ├─ Track A: Integration Tests (20+)\n    ├─ Track B: TestFlight Beta (50 users)\n    └─ Track C: Production Rollout (0%→100%)\n\n  ---\n  🚀 Ready to Start Immediately\n\n  No blockers for Sprint 1:\n  - All user stories have acceptance criteria\n  - Code snippets provided\n  - Test strategy defined\n  - Demo script ready\n\n  Recommended start: Monday, February 3, 2026\n\n  ---\n  📋 What You Can Do Now\n\n  Option 1: Start Sprint 1 Implementation\n  cd /Users/juju/dev_repos/swiftwing\n  open .omc/epics/SPRINT-1-QUICK-START.md\n  # Follow day-by-day guide\n\n  Option 2: Review Sprint Plans\n  open .omc/epics/sprint-plans/\n  # Read through all 5 sprint plans\n\n  Option 3: Setup Project Tracking\n  - Import user stories to GitHub Issues\n  - Create project board with 3 tracks\n  - Assign developers to tracks\n\n  Option 4: Coordinate with Backend Team\n  - Share Sprint 3 Talaria endpoint requirements\n  - Schedule integration planning meeting\n\n  ---\n  🎯 Critical Success Factors\n\n  1. Review Tab is Essential\n    - Multi-book needs visual grid\n    - Users must verify AI before saving\n    - Progressive enrichment visible here\n  2. Parallel Tracks Work\n    - Track A (Segmentation) must complete first\n    - Tracks B/C can run concurrently with A\n    - Total velocity: 3x faster than sequential\n  3. Foundation Models Accuracy\n    - Target: >90% (measure in Sprint 4)\n    - If achieved: Prove we can reduce Talaria dependency\n    - If not: Keep hybrid approach long-term\n  4. Cost Savings Validation\n    - Expected: $200/month savings\n    - Must validate in production\n    - ROI justifies entire epic\n\n  ---\n  💡 Next Steps\n\n  1. Review all documents (30 min)\n  2. Assign team members to tracks (15 min)\n  3. Create feature branch (5 min)\n  4. Kickoff Sprint 1 (Monday)"
