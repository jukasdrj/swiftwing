  "task_description": "Implement critical gaps and high-value features from BOOKSHELF_SCANNER_LESSONS.md for swiftwing repository only. Focus on: 1) Image preprocessing pipeline (contrast, brightness, denoising, rotation detection), 2) SSE disconnection detection with backend cleanup, 3) Review queue UI for low-confidence books, 4) Progressive results UX with segmented image preview. Coordinate with existing Epic 5 refactoring work. Exclude wingtip repository from all changes.",
