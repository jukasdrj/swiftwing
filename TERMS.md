SwiftWing is an iOS application that provides:
- Camera-based book spine scanning
- AI-powered book identification and metadata retrieval

The app is provided free of charge with no in-app purchases or subscriptions.

## 3. User Responsibilities

For detailed privacy practices, see our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).

## 5. AI-Generated Metadata

SwiftWing uses AI to identify books and retrieve metadata. You acknowledge that:

## 6. Offline Mode and Data Queue

When offline:
- Scans are queued locally on your device
- Queued scans auto-upload when network connectivity returns
- You can manually delete queued scans at any time
- We are not responsible for lost queue data due to app deletion or device issues

## 7. Third-Party Services

SwiftWing integrates with our Talaria API (`https://api.oooefam.net`) for AI processing. By using the app, you agree to:
- Send book spine images to Talaria for analysis
- Receive metadata from Talaria via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Accept that Talaria uptime is not guaranteed (the service may experience downtime)

**Talaria Rate Limits:**
